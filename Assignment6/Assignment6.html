<h1>Assignment 6</h1>


<ol>
	<li>For this assignment, you will be creating a basic HTML page which includes simple JavaScript functionality.  Please make use of the resources at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">http://www.w3schools.com</a> (or any site you like) for reference information as necessary.  You must write your page "by hand", meaning that you are not allowed to use an HTML editor or application which writes HTML for you.  Also, as with all assignments which require a web browser, your submission will be tested and must work correctly in the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome browser</a>.</li><br><br>

	<li>Create a file named FirstLast.html (where "First" is replaced with your first name and "Last" with your last name).  Create a title for your page (using the "title" tag) and a main heading (using the "h1" tag), both with the text "First Last's page" (again substituting your name), and set the background color to something other than white (but which still allows you easily to read the text).</li><br><br>
	
	<li>This page will consist of a quiz about a topic of your choosing.  The quiz must contain three questions, with more details to be explained.  Add a few sentences describing the page and a link to another web page (somewhere on the WWW, not included in this assignment) which gives more information about the topic of the quiz.  Your link must be designed so that when clicked on, it opens the page in a new window (or tab).  [Hint: Look at the "target" attribute for links.]</li><br><br>

	<li>Your quiz must contain three multiple choice questions, each with three answer options to select from.  Add the necessary JavaScript so that when someone clicks on an answer option, text immediately below that question and its possible answers displays whether the selection was correct or incorrect.  Each time an option is clicked, that message should be correctly updated. Also note that when the page is originally loaded, there should be no such feedback messages visible.</li><br><br> 
	
	<li>One of the questions must have images included in the possible answers so that users click on an image to select their answer. (This will mean that you need to include the images with your submission!)</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Add a button with the text "Reset" at the bottom of the page.  When the user clicks this button, the feedback on their past answers should completely disappear (but the questions and answer options should remain).  This should effectively reset the page to its original state before the user selected any answers, and the functionality for selecting answers and getting feedback should still work correctly.</li><br><br>

	<li>Here is the rubric the grader will use, so make sure your page meets each of these requirements:
		<ol>
			<li>(5 points) Does the HTML file have the correct name?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does the page have the correct title?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does the page have the correct heading?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Is the background color set to something other than white?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Are there a few sentences about the page which include a link to an external page?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does clicking on the link cause it to open in a new browser window or tab?</li>
			<li>(5 points each) Are there 3 quiz questions?</li>
			<li>(10 points) Does one of the quiz questions have (correctly loaded) images for its possible answers?</li>
			<li>(10 points for each question) Does clicking on an answer for the question option cause a feedback message to be correctly displayed below that question and its answers? Is this correctly updated on every click of an answer?</li>
			<li>(10 points) Is there a button which can be clicked to remove all feedback messages which have been displayed?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does all functionality of the page still work correctly after pressing the "Reset" button?</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br><br>

	<li>Submit a zip file in the usual manner. The zip file should contain your HTML file and image files.  <b>Test your zip file before you submit it by extracting into a separate folder and then opening your web page from that new folder. Ensure that it works (in Chrome) as expected, especially finding all images as necessary.</b> </li><br><br>
</ol>
